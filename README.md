# ASP.NET Core 2.1 Angular SPA on .NET 4.7

This is to test out NSwag integration with ASP.NET Core 2.1 with Angular SPA client on .NET 4.7.

This was created using the ASP.NET Core wizard in VS 2017 (15.8.4) selecting the Angular option (so using the ASP.NET Core Angular SPA template).

## Modifications from the generated Template

 - Upgraded to angular6 and typescript 2.7
 - Added NSwag and swagger integration to app and clientapp.

Easiest way to see the differences is to diff the commits.
